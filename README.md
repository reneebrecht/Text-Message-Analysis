# Text Message Analysis <br>
Here are some possible ideas for analysis:

Conduct sentiment analysis on the text messages.
Find the most common topics users text about.
Determine how similar various usersâ€™ texts are (by topic, vocabulary use, or Levenshtein distance).
Figure out what kinds of biases exist in the text message data.
Create frequency distributions for messaging, sentiments, or key words/phrases.
Use POS tagging to find commonly used phrases.
